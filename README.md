## Why I am gonna learn all this?
So I have been through Android app development, tried my hands in the field of web development but after having my hands in them I have realized that what these all development stuff is great it gives the sense of accomplishment but when I've looked inside what I have seen is that these technologies are shells that beautifully covers the arc reactor that powers these technologies. 

The arc reactor for the computer science is the great underlying study of algorithms and data structures that has been developed after years of our learning and understanding of the data and our needs.

 ou can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mehuled/my-experiments-with-algorithms/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
